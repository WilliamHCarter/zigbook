# Introduction

Welcome to "The Zig Programming Language," an introductory book about Zig.

## Who Zig Is For

Zig is ideal for:

- Systems programmers who want better safety without sacrificing performance
- Developers looking for a modern alternative to C
- Programmers who value simplicity and clarity in their code
- Anyone interested in low-level programming with modern tooling

## How to Use This Book

This book assumes you're familiar with programming in at least one other language. We'll start with the basics and progressively build up to more complex topics.

### Code Examples

All code examples in this book are available in the accompanying repository. We encourage you to type them out yourself to build muscle memory, but you can also copy and paste if you prefer.
