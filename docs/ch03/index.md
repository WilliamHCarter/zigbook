# Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers fundamental concepts that appear in almost every programming language and how they work in Zig.

## What You'll Learn

We'll explore:

- Variables and mutability
- Data types
- Functions
- Comments
- Control flow

These are the building blocks you'll use in every Zig program you write.
